In order to ensure righteous practices and the fair judging of any and all cases, and to further eliminate any possibility of misconduct by both the verdict made by the government representative and the judge and/or jury, these verdicts may also be tested against the verdict of what may be considered omnipotent, otherworldly forces by essentially putting them against each other in a (singular) round of chance.

Whichever verdict is deemed appropriate and selected by these outside forces will then be the definite verdict/outcome of said case. This may be done with the usage of a device (recommended to be electrical, however more traditional methods that involve paper slips may also be used).
