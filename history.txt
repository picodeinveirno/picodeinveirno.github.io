It did not snow often. At least, not the typical snow they had heard of, the snow that snowed in the north. There, their snow was white and cold and melted when they held it between their hands. It could be rolled into compact balls of snow with pebbles stabbed into the delicate substance for eyes.


The north was the land of snowmen. 


They could make snowmen here too. They had snow, it just didn’t fall from the sky. It littered the fields and grew from the spindly arms of the Earth, was then stuffed and stored into bags– body bags, really, for all those many snowmen– and dragged off and sold for the threads of their skin and veins. 


If the snowmen of the north could sing and dance, if they could toast each other in merry spirit, then the snowmen along the border lived only for their bodies– they were rarely ever given eyes.


Perhaps they were worth more than the ones naturally born– instead of cold crystals that pierced the skin at a molecular level, those soft threads could easily envelop a person, bringing them warmth without ever having the arms to do so. And it may have been because of this that led those southern people to call their snow by another name: cotton. 


There were times where bullets would rain on their fields dotted with white. Like hail, except it seemed to move at such speeds that could rip through the skin of the weary hands reaching to harvest those threads that their fates were seemingly tied to. And there were far too many lifelines, far too many lives that were as delicate as each of those threads, valuable as how the cotton they picked was– it was not that the snowmen or the people were alive– it was that they could be sold.


And the bullets would pierce the southern snow. Those bullets would give the snowmen eyes, and they would finally get to see the world– a world that lacked snow, of course.


That is not to say snow was something completely foreign to them. Natural snow– snow that came from the sky. It would come every once in a while, never for long, but winter chills were not completely unheard of. So over the next few years, there were some days where though all their snow– all their cotton had been picked and the fields were bare, the land that gave way to the mountain peaks were once more blanketed in white during those December months. 


And so the years went by. The ones that harvested the cotton went free, or as free as they could be while they did not have the means to live free. They were like their snowmen, in some ways– they were the ones that were sold, they were the ones who were granted eyes only through bullets that tore through skin.



But the matter at hand concerns these people less. It has been years now since they came to pick the cotton, and the crop has come to know many moral human souls since all those years ago. Rather, it is the weather that must take center stage now.


Winter was rather mild in its dealings with those lands. Snow. No snow. White Christmases few and far between. Seeing snow– being able to see snow regularly, to be of those people that could be swept up and away by the winter winds to a wonderland of white flakes– it was a privilege, of sorts, that many could not– and cannot– say they had.


But they had snow. They had it in their fields, and their snowmen were far softer for it. It was not even as if it never snowed. And yet, the abundance of cotton snowmen– fake snowmen, in some ways– made snowmen made from the offerings of the sky all the more, well, special. Perhaps the division became somewhat blurred as time went on. And yet, it still remained; cotton snow and snow. They were different– the snowmen made from them were different– and the people that made them all the more divided by the nature of their creations.
